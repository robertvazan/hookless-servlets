Reactive servlet as implemented in [`ReactiveServlet`](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/javadocs/servlets/com.machinezoo.hookless.servlets/com/machinezoo/hookless/servlets/ReactiveServlet.html) class
is a [reactive adapter](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/adapters) for Jakarta's
[`HttpServlet`](https://javadoc.io/static/jakarta.servlet/jakarta.servlet-api/5.0.0/jakarta/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html).
Reactive servlet is a [reactive consumer](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/consumer).
It will keep running its handler method until the handler no longer [reactively blocks](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/blocking).
It will then send the last output of the handler to the client as an HTTP response.
Reactive servlet is fully asynchronous. It never blocks servlet container threads.
