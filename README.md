# Hookless Servlets #

Hookless Servlets, a part of [Hookless](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/) project, is a Java library that implements [reactive servlets](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/servlets) as a [reactive adapter](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/adapters) for Java EE's servlets.

## Status ##

The library is undocumented but functional and fairly stable. Class-level progress is tracked using [Stagean annotations](https://stagean.machinezoo.com/).
