Reactive servlet as implemented in [`ReactiveServlet`](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/javadocs/servlets/com.machinezoo.hookless.servlets/com/machinezoo/hookless/servlets/ReactiveServlet.html) class
is a [reactive adapter](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/adapters) for Java EE's
[`HttpServlet`](https://javadoc.io/static/jakarta.servlet/jakarta.servlet-api/5.0.0/jakarta/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html).
Reactive servlet is a reactive consumer. It will keep running its handler method until the handler no longer reactively blocks.
It will then send the last output of the handler to the client as an HTTP response.
Reactive servlet is fully asynchronous. It never blocks servlet container's threads.
